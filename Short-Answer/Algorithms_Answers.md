## Exercise I

a) O(n)

    This while loop has a time complexity of O(n) because it is iterating through all the data that is less than a given value of n starting at a (index 0) and incrementing a n times until the while loops comparison is satisfy.

b) O(n log n)

    The first for loop is O(n) because it iterates through the entire collection of data. However the nested while loop will run at O of log(n). 

c) 0(n)

    This recursive function will run n times because the input starts at n and decreases by 1 each time.
